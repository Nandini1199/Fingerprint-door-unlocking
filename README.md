#Fingerprint-door-unlocking
This project aims at making a fingerprint door unlocking system. 
Components used:
	Arduino Uno, Fingerprint Module,Push Button,LEDs,Resistors,Power Supply,connecting wires,Cardboard Box,Servo Motor,bread Board.
  
Basic Working:
1.	Take the fingerprint input from the user and store it as a template. 
2.	Arrange the hardware components and make all the connections as required.
3.	Upload the code to Arduino.
4.	Now the user can try to access the door.
5.	User need to give fingerprint input through the finger print sensor.
6.	If this input matches the template fingerprint, the door connected to servo motor opens and a message is displayed ‘Welcome’.
7.	Else if the input does not match the template fingerprint, the door does not open and a message is displayed ‘Unauthorized access ’.

PROGRESS:
a)I have completed the project. The change that I made in my plan was to use serial monitor instead of the LCD display.

PLAN:
Firstly, I am  trying to make a basic code which will save the fingerprint as template and then check for the access evertim by comparing with the template.
Later when this code works successfully I might try few of the other features:
a)adding more templates
b)deleting some templates
